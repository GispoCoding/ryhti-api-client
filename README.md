# Ryhti API Client

This is a semi automatically generated API Client for the Ryhti API. The client library is generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project and modified to fit the needs of the Ryhti project.

The library includes clients for the Ryhti Data Exchange Layer Api (Palveluväylä / Xroad) and the Public Validation API. Those share same models, but have different API endpoints.

This project is developed and maintained by Gispo Finland Ltd. and is not affiliated with the Ryhti project.

## Installation

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GispoCoding/ryhti-api-client.git
```

## Usage



## Developing

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for development.

Python files gererated by the OpenAPI Generator are not meant to be edited manually. Instead, the API specifications are edited in the `api_specs` directory and the client is regenerated using the scripts provided.

### Running tests

```
uv run pytest
```

### Updating the client version

```shell

uv run bash scripts/generate_client.sh v2025-release-23
uv run bash scripts/copy_generated_client.sh xroad
# Inspect modified files and commit changes
uv run bash scripts/copy_generated_client.sh public
# Inspect modified files and commit changes
```
